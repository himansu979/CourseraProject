coursera practical Machine Learning project

course project by Himansu Sahoo

Project Description
In this project, we will use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

The dataset is Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset.

The training data for this project are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv

The test data are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the “classe” variable in the training set. You may use any of the other variables to predict with.
